## Simple definition/main idea
Composition is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming where a class is composed of one or more objects of other classes. It allows for the creation of complex objects by combining simpler objects, forming a "has-a" relationship between the classes involved.

## Syntax/Implementation
In Java, composition is implemented by creating instance variables of other classes within a class. The composed objects are created and initialized within the class's constructor or other methods.
```java
class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}

class Engine {
    // Engine class implementation...
}
```

## Technical Details
Composition establishes a strong relationship between the composing class (the container) and the composed classes (the components). **The container class has control over the lifecycle of the composed objects and can access their methods and properties.**

## Key Concepts/Components
- Composing class: The class that contains one or more instances of other classes.
- Composed class: The class whose instances are used as components within the composing class.
- "Has-a" relationship: Composition represents a "has-a" relationship between the composing class and the composed classes.
- Composition allows the reuse of code.
- Java doesn’t support multiple inheritances but by using composition we can achieve it.
- Composition offers better test-ability of a class.
- By using composition, we are flexible enough to replace the implementation of a composed class with a better and improved version.
- By using composition, we can also change the member objects at run time, to dynamically change the behaviour of your program.

## Best Practices
- Identify meaningful relationships: Use composition when there is a clear and meaningful relationship between the composing class and the composed classes.
- Encapsulate behavior: Delegate specific functionality to the composed objects to promote encapsulation and separation of concerns.
- Use interfaces or abstract classes: Consider using interfaces or abstract classes to define contracts between the composing class and the composed classes, allowing for flexibility and polymorphism.

## Limitations/Considerations
- Composition can lead to tightly coupled code if not used carefully.
- Modifying the composed classes may impact the composing class.
- Composition is a static relationship, meaning that the composed objects cannot be changed dynamically during runtime.

## Example of impementation
> Let’s understand the composition in Java with the example of books and library. In this example, we create a class _Book_ that contains data members like author, and title and create another class _Library_ that has a reference to refer to the list of books. A library can have no. of **books** on the same or different subjects. So, If the Library gets destroyed then All books within that particular library will be destroyed. i.e., books can not exist without a library. The relationship between the library and books is composition.

```java
// Java program to Illustrate Concept of Composition

// Importing required classes
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

// Class 1
// Helper class
// Book class
class Book {

	// Member variables of this class
	public String title;
	public String author;

	// Constructor of this class
	Book(String title, String author) {

		// This keyword refers top current instance
		this.title = title;
		this.author = author;
	}
}

// Class 2
// Helper class
// Library class contains list of books.
class Library {

	// Reference to refer to list of books.
	private final List<Book> books;

	// Constructor of this class
	Library(List<Book> books) {

		// This keyword refers to current instance itself
		this.books = books;
	}

	// Method of this class
	// Getting the list of books
	public List<Book> getListOfBooksInLibrary() {
		return books;
	}
}

// Class 3
// Main class
class GFG {

	// Main driver method
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		// Creating the objects of class 1 (Book class)
		// inside main() method
		Book b1
			= new Book("EffectiveJ Java", "Joshua Bloch");
		Book b2
			= new Book("Thinking in Java", "Bruce Eckel");
		Book b3 = new Book("Java: The Complete Reference",
						"Herbert Schildt");

		// Creating the list which contains the
		// no. of books.
		List<Book> book = new ArrayList<Book>();

		// Adding books to List object
		// using standard add() method
		book.add(b1);
		book.add(b2);
		book.add(b3);

		// Creating an object of class 2
		Library library = new Library(book);

		// Calling method of class 2 and storing list of
		// books in List Here List is declared of type
		// Books(user-defined)
		List<Book> books
			= library.getListOfBooksInLibrary();

		// Iterating over for each loop
		for (Book bk : books) {

			// Print and display the title and author of
			// books inside List object
			System.out.println("Title : " + bk.title
							+ " and "
							+ " Author : " + bk.author);
		}
	}
}
```

Output:
```
Title : EffectiveJ Java and  Author : Joshua Bloch
Title : Thinking in Java and  Author : Bruce Eckel
Title : Java: The Complete Reference and  Author : Herbert Schildt
```
