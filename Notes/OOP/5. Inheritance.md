## Simple definition/main idea
**Take the existing class, clone it, and then make additions and modifications to the clone.** However if the original class (aka. base class | superclass | parent class) is changed the modified "clone" (aka derived class | inherited class | subclass | child class) also reflects those changes.

## Technical definition
A type does more than describe the constraints on a set of objects; it also has a relationship with other types. Two types can have characteristics and behaviors in common, but one type may contain more characteristics than another and may also handle more messages (or handle them differently). Inheritance expresses this similarity between types by using the concept of base types and derived types. A base type contains all of the characteristics and behaviors that are shared among the types derived from it. You create a base type to represent the core of your ideas about some objects in your system. From the base type, you derive other types to express the different ways that this core can be realized.

### Base types/class
A base type contains all of the characteristics and behaviors that are shared among the types derived from it. From the base type, you derive other types to express the different ways that this core can be realized.


### Differentiate the new derived class from the original base class
- Add brand new methods to the derived class. These new methods are not part of the base-class interface
- Change the behavior of an existing base-class method. This is referred to as [[6. Overriding|overriding]] that method.
