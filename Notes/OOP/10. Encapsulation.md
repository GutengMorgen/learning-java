## Simple definition/main idea
**This principle states that all important information is contained inside an object and only select information is exposed.** **Encapsulation in Java** is a _process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit_, for example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.

## Sintaxis/How to implement it
In Java, encapsulation is achieved by declaring the instance variables of a class as `private`, which means they can only be accessed within the class. To allow outside access to the instance variables, `public` methods called getters and setters are defined, which are used to retrieve and modify the values of the instance variables, respectively. By using getters and setters, the class can enforce its own data validation rules and ensure that its internal state remains consistent.

The access modifiers in Java are:
- `private`: Accessible only within the same class.
- `public`: Accessible from any class.
- `protected`: Accessible within the same package or subclasses.
- Default (no modifier): Accessible within the same package only.

## Technical definition
Encapsulation combines data and methods into a single unit called a class. The data (variables) in a class are usually declared as private, meaning they can only be accessed within the same class. To provide controlled access to these variables, public methods (getters and setters) are defined in the class. These methods allow other classes to interact with the private variables indirectly, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

By providing only a setter or getter method, you can make the class **read-only or write-only**. In other words, you can skip the getter or setter methods.

It provides you the **control over the data**. Suppose you want to set the value of id which should be greater than 100 only, you can write the logic inside the setter method. You can write the logic not to store the negative numbers in the setter methods.

It is a way to achieve **data hiding** in Java because other class will not be able to access the data through the private data members.

- **Data Hiding:** it is a way of restricting the access of our data members by hiding the implementation details. Encapsulation also provides a way for data hiding. The user will have no idea about the inner implementation of the class. It will not be visible to the user how the class is storing values in the variables. The user will only know that we are passing the values to a setter method and variables are getting initialized with that value.
- **Increased Flexibility:** We can make the variables of the class read-only or write-only depending on our requirements. If we wish to make the variables read-only then we have to omit the setter methods like setName(), setAge(), etc. from the above program or if we wish to make the variables write-only then we have to omit the get methods like getName(), getAge(), etc. from the above program
- **Reusability:** Encapsulation also improves the re-usability and is easy to change with new requirements.

## Component/Complements


## Tips to use it
- Declare variables as private and provide public methods to access and modify them. This ensures data encapsulation and allows for controlled access and manipulation of the object's state.
- Follow the principle of information hiding by exposing only the necessary methods and hiding the internal implementation details.
- Use meaningful method names that clearly indicate the purpose or action being performed.

## Limitations/Considerations
- Overuse of getters and setters can lead to an anemic domain model, where the class contains mostly data with minimal behavior. Care should be taken to balance data and behavior within a class.
- Direct access to private variables through reflection or other means can bypass encapsulation, so developers should be mindful of maintaining the intended encapsulation boundaries.

## Example of impementation
```java
public class BankAccount {
    private double balance;

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount();
        account.deposit(1000);
        account.withdraw(500);
        System.out.println("Account balance: " + account.getBalance());
    }
}
```
In the above example, the `BankAccount` class encapsulates the `balance` variable and provides public methods (`getBalance()`, `deposit()`, `withdraw()`) to access and modify the balance. The private `balance` variable can only be accessed through the defined public methods, ensuring controlled access to the account balance.


```java
public class Employee {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private double salary;

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setSalary(double salary) {
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    public double getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }
}
```
In this example, the `Employee` class encapsulates the attributes `name`, `age`, and `salary` by making them private. Public getter and setter methods are provided to access and modify these attributes. This encapsulation ensures that the internal state of the `Employee` object is properly controlled and accessed through a defined interface.
