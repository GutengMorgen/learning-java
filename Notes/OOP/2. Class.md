## Simple definition/main idea
_Collection of a type of objectsÂ is called class_. It is a logical entity. A class can also be defined as _a blueprint from which you can create an individual object_. Class doesn't consume any space.

## Technical definition
...

Java uses three explicit [[_Keywords|keywords]] to set the boundaries in a class:
- public: the following element is available to everyone
- private: means that no one can access that element except you, the creator of the type, inside methods of that type.
- protected: The protected keyword acts like private, with the exception that an inheriting class has access to protected members, but not private members.
- default: This is usually called package access because classes can access the members of other classes in the same package (library component), but outside of the package those same members appear to be private
