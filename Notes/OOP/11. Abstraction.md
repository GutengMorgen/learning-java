## Simple definition/main idea
Focuses on **representing essential features and behavior while hiding unnecessary details**. It allows us to create models that capture the essence of real-world objects and concepts.
A class which is declared as `abstract` is known as an **abstract class**. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods. It needs to be extended and its method implemented. **It cannot be instantiated.**

## Syntax/Implementation
In Java, abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces. Abstract classes provide a way to define common characteristics and behavior that subclasses can inherit. Interfaces define a contract of methods that classes implementing the interface must implement.

```java
abstract class A{}
```

## Technical Details
Abstraction allows us to define abstract classes and interfaces that serve as blueprints for more specific, concrete classes. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated and may contain both abstract and concrete methods. Interfaces, on the other hand, can only contain abstract method signatures and constants.

In Java, abstraction is achieved by [[3. Interface|interfaces]] and abstract classes. **We can achieve 100% abstraction using interfaces.**

### When use it
There are situations in which we will want to define a superclass that declares the structure of a given abstraction without providing a complete implementation of every method. Sometimes we will want to create a superclass that only defines a generalization form that will be shared by all of its subclasses, leaving it to each subclass to fill in the details.

### Encapsulation vs Data Abstraction
1. Encapsulation is data hiding(information hiding) while Abstraction is detailed hiding(implementation hiding).
2. While encapsulation groups together data and methods that act upon the data, data abstraction deal with exposing the interface to the user and hiding the details of implementation.
3. Encapsulated classes are Java classes that follow data hiding and abstraction We can implement abstraction by using abstract classes and interfaces. 
4. Encapsulation is a procedure that takes place at the implementation level, while abstraction is a design-level process.

## Key Concepts/Components
- Abstract class: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is intended to be extended by subclasses. **It can contain both abstract and concrete methods.**
- Interface: **An interface is a collection of abstract method signatures and constant definitions.** It defines a contract that classes implementing the interface must adhere to.
- Abstract method: **An abstract method is a method declaration without an implementation.** It is meant to be implemented by subclasses or classes implementing an interface.
- It can have [[12. Constructor|constructors]] and static methods also.
- It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.
- An abstract method is a method that is declared without implementation.
- An abstract class may or may not have all abstract methods. Some of them can be concrete methods
- A method-defined abstract must always be redefined in the subclass, thus making overriding compulsory or making the subclass itself abstract.
- Any class that contains one or more abstract methods must also be declared with an abstract keyword.
- There can be no object of an abstract class. That is, an abstract class can not be directly instantiated with the [_new operator_](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/new-operator-java/).
- An abstract class can have parameterized constructors and the default constructor is always present in an abstract class.

## Best Practices
- Use abstraction to model real-world concepts: Identify the essential characteristics and behavior of objects and create abstract classes or interfaces to capture those aspects.
- Encourage code reusability: Abstract classes and interfaces promote code reuse by defining common behavior and contracts that multiple classes can implement.
- Design to interfaces: Program to the interfaces rather than concrete classes to achieve loose coupling and flexibility in the codebase.

## Limitations/Considerations
- Over-abstraction: Creating too many abstract classes or interfaces can lead to unnecessary complexity and make the code harder to understand.
- Inconsistency in abstraction: If some parts of the system are more abstract than others, it can be difficult to maintain consistency.

## Example of impementation
```java
// Java Program to implement
// Java Abstraction

// Abstract Class declared
abstract class Animal {
	private String name;

	public Animal(String name) { this.name = name; }

	public abstract void makeSound();

	public String getName() { return name; }
}

// Abstracted class
class Dog extends Animal {
	public Dog(String name) { super(name); }

	public void makeSound()
	{
		System.out.println(getName() + " barks");
	}
}

// Abstracted class
class Cat extends Animal {
	public Cat(String name) { super(name); }

	public void makeSound()
	{
		System.out.println(getName() + " meows");
	}
}

// Driver Class
public class AbstractionExample {
	// Main Function
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Animal myDog = new Dog("Buddy");
		Animal myCat = new Cat("Fluffy");

		myDog.makeSound();
		myCat.makeSound();
	}
}
```

Output:
```
Buddy barks
Fluffy meows
```

This code defines an Animal abstract class with an abstract method makeSound(). The Dog and Cat classes extend Animal and implement the makeSound() method. The main() method creates instances of Dog and Cat and calls the makeSound() method on them. 

This demonstrates the abstraction concept in Java, where we define a template for a class (in this case Animal), but leave the implementation of certain methods to be defined by subclasses (in this case makeSound()).
