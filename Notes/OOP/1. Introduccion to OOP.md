## Simple definition/main idea
The main aim/idia of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

## Technical definition
Alan Kay summarized five basic characteristics of **Smalltalk**, one of the languages upon which **Java** is based. These characteristics represent a pure approach to object-oriented programming: 
1. **Everything is an object.** Think of an object as a fancy variable; it stores data, but you can “make requests” to that object, asking it to perform operations on itself. In theory, you can take any conceptual component in the problem you’re trying to solve (dogs, buildings, services, etc.) and represent it as an object in your program.
2. **A program is a bunch of objects telling each other what to do by sending messages.** To make a request of an object, you “send a message” to that object. More concretely, you can think of a message as a request to call a method that belongs to a particular object.
3. **Each object has its own memory made up of other objects.** Put another way, you create a new kind of object by making a package containing existing objects. Thus, you can build complexity into a program while hiding it behind the simplicity of objects.
4. **Every object has a type.** Using the parlance, each object is an instance of a class, in which “class” is synonymous with “type.” The most important distinguishing characteristic of a class is “What messages can you send to it?”
5. **All objects of a particular type can receive the same messages.** This is actually a loaded statement, as you will see later. Because an object of type “circle” is also an object of type “shape,” a circle is guaranteed to accept shape messages. This means you can write code that talks to shapes and automatically handle anything that fits the description of a shape. This substitutability is one of the powerful concepts in OOP.

*"... So, although what we really do in object-oriented programming is create new data types, virtually all object-oriented programming languages use the “class” keyword. When you see the word “type” think “class” and vice versa."*

Once a class is established, you can make as many objects of that [[2. Class|class]] as you like, and then manipulate those objects as if they are the elements that exist in the problem you are trying to solve.

### How do you get an object to do useful work for you?
There needs to be a way to make a request of the object so that it will do something, such as complete a transaction or turn on a switch. *And each object can satisfy only certain requests. The requests you can make of an object are defined by its [[3. Interface|interface]]*, and the type/class is what determines the interface.

#### Example:

![[Pasted image 20230626143625.png]]

Here, the name of the type/class is Light, the name of this particular Light object is lt, and the requests that you can make of a Light object are to turn it on, turn it off, make it brighter, or make it dimmer. You create a Light object by defining a “reference” (lt) for that object and calling new to request a new object of that type. To send a message to the object, you state the name of the object and connect it to the message request with a period (dot). From the standpoint of the user of a predefined class, that’s pretty much all there is to programming with objects.



### Reusing classes
The simplest way to reuse a class is to just use an object of that class directly, but you can also **place an object of that class inside a new class**. We call this **“creating a member object.”** Your new class can be made up of any number and type of other objects, in any combination that you need to achieve the functionality desired in your new class.
Because you are composing a new class from existing classes, this concept is called [[4. Composition|composition]] (if the composition happens dynamically, it’s usually called **aggregation**).

#### Inheritance
Take the existing class, clone it, and then make additions and modifications to the clone. This is effectively what you get with inheritance, with the exception that if the original class (called the base class or superclass or parent class) is changed, the modified “clone” (called the derived class or inherited class or subclass or child class) also reflects those changes.

Some concepts to reuse classes:
- [[4. Composition|Composition]]
- Aggregation
- [[5. Inheritance|Inheritance]]

### Tips
- **One of the best ways to think about objects is as “service providers.”** Your program itself will provide services to the user, and it will accomplish this by using the services offered by other objects.
- In a good object-oriented design, **each object does one thing well, but doesn’t try to do too much.**
