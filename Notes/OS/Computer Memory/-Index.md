The memory management function keeps track of the status of each memory location, either _allocated_ or _free_. **It determines how memory is allocated among competing processes, deciding which gets memory, when they receive it, and how much they are allowed.** When memory is allocated it determines which memory locations will be assigned. It tracks when memory is freed or _unallocated_ and updates the status.
