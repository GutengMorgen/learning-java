A memory management unit (MMU) is a computer hardware component that **handles all memory and caching operations associated with the processor**. In other words, the MMU is responsible for all aspects of memory management.

**Memory management at the hardware level.**
Memory management at the hardware level is concerned with the physical components that store data, most notably the [[Memory Hierarchy#RAM|RAM]] chips and CPU [[Memory Hierarchy#Cache|memory caches]]. Most of the management that occurs at the physical level is handled by the memory management unit (MMU), which controls the processor's memory and caching operations. **One of the MMU's most important roles is to translate the logical addresses used by the running processes to the physical addresses on the memory devices.**

The MMU also includes a section of memory that holds a table that matches virtual addresses to physical addresses, called the translation lookaside buffer (TLB).

# Physical Address
A physical address is the actual address in main memory where data is stored. *It is a location in physical memory such as RAM, ROM, SSD, or hard drive.* **Physical addresses are used by the memory management unit (MMU)** to translate logical addresses into physical addresses.

The translation from logical addresses to physical addresses is performed by the MMU. The MMU uses techniques like paging or segmentation, and a page table or segment table to map logical addresses to physical addresses.

## Physical Address space
the physical address space **refers to the size or capacity of the main memory** in a computer system.

# Logical Address (Virtual Address)
A logical address, also known as a virtual address, **is an address generated by the CPU during program/process execution.** It is the address seen by the process and is relative to the program’s address space.

**The logical address must be mapped to the physical address by MMU before they are used.**

## Logical Address Space
The logical address space represents the total range of logical addresses that a program or process can utilize.
The term Logical Address Space is used for the set of all logical addresses generated by a program’s perspective. The logical address space is **determined by the size of the process or program.**

In other words, **the logical address is a specific address value that identifies a location in the virtual memory**, while **the logical address space defines the entire range of possible addresses that a program or process can use** within its own memory context.

|Parameter|LOGICAL ADDRESS|PHYSICAL ADDRESS|
|---|---|---|
|Address Space|Logical Address Space is set of all logical addresses generated by CPU in reference to a program.|Physical Address is set of all physical addresses mapped to the corresponding logical addresses.|
|Visibility|User can view the logical address of a program.|User can never view physical address of program.|
|Generation|**generated by the CPU**|**Computed by MMU**|
|Editable|Logical address can be change.|Physical address will not change.|

# Address Spaces
Address space is the amount of memory allocated for all possible addresses for a computational entity like a device, a file, a server or a networked computer. The system provides each device and process address space that holds a specific portion of the processor's address space. This can include either physical or virtual addresses accessible to a processor or reserved for a particular process.
