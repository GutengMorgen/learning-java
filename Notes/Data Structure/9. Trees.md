A tree is a non-linear and hierarchical data structure where the elements are arranged in a tree-like structure. In a tree, the topmost node is called the root node. **Each node contains some data, and data can be of any type. It consists of a central node, structural nodes, and sub-nodes which are connected via edges.** Different tree data structures allow quicker and easier access to the data as it is a non-linear data structure. A tree has various terminologies like *Node, Root, Edge, Height of a tree, Degree of a tree, etc.*

There are different types of Tree-like 

- [Binary Tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-data-structure/), 
- [Binary Search Tree](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-tree-set-1-search-and-insertion/), 
- [AVL Tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/avl-tree-set-1-insertion/), 
- [B-Tree,](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-b-tree-2/) etc.

## **Characteristics of a Tree:** 

The tree has various different characteristics which are as follows:

- A tree is **also known as a Recursive data structure.**
- In a tree, the Height of the root can be defined as the longest path from the root node to the leaf node.
- In a tree, one can also calculate the depth from the top to any node. The root node has a depth of 0.

## Operation performed on tree:

A tree is a non-linear data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. Here are some common operations performed on trees:

- **Insertion**: New nodes can be added to the tree to create a new branch or to increase the height of the tree.
- **Deletion**: Nodes can be removed from the tree by updating the references of the parent node to remove the reference to the current node.
- **Search**: Elements can be searched for in a tree by starting from the root node and traversing the tree based on the value of the current node until the desired node is found.
- **Traversal**: The elements in a tree can be traversed in several different ways, including in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal.
- **Height**: The height of the tree can be determined by counting the number of edges from the root node to the furthest leaf node.
- **Depth**: The depth of a node can be determined by counting the number of edges from the root node to the current node.
- **Balancing**: The tree can be balanced to ensure that the height of the tree is minimized and the distribution of nodes is as even as possible.

## Applications of Tree:

Different applications of Tree are as follows:

- **Heap is a tree data structure that is implemented using arrays and used to implement priority queues.**
- **B- Tree** and **B+ Tree** are used to implement indexing in databases.
- Syntax Tree helps in scanning, parsing, generation of code, and evaluation of arithmetic expressions in Compiler design.
- **K-D Tree is a space partitioning tree used to organize points in K-dimensional space.**
- **Spanning trees are used in routers in computer networks.**
