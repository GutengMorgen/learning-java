Queue is a **linear data structure** that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is [First In First Out(FIFO)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fifo-first-in-first-out-approach-in-programming/) i.e. the data item stored first will be accessed first. In this, **entering and retrieving data is not done from only one end.** An example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. Different operations are performed on a Queue like Reversing a Queue (with or without using recursion), Reversing the first K elements of a Queue, etc. A few basic operations performed In Queue are enqueue, dequeue, front, rear, etc.

## Characteristics of a Queue:

The queue has various different characteristics which are as follows:

- The queue is a FIFO (First In First Out) structure.
- To remove the last element of the Queue, all the elements inserted before the new element in the queue must be removed.
- A queue is an ordered list of elements of similar data types.

## Operation performed on queue:

A queue is a linear data structure that implements the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Here are some common operations performed on queues:

- **Enqueue**: Elements can be added to the back of the queue, adding a new element to the end of the queue.
- **Dequeue**: The front element can be removed from the queue by performing a dequeue operation, effectively removing the first element that was added to the queue.
- **Peek**: The front element can be inspected without removing it from the queue using a peek operation.
- **IsEmpty**: A check can be made to determine if the queue is empty.
- **Size**: The number of elements in the queue can be determined using a size operation.

## Applications of Queue:

Different applications of Queue are as follows:

- Queue is used **for handling website traffic.**
- It helps to maintain the playlist in media players.
- Queue is used in operating systems for handling interrupts.
- It helps in serving requests on a single shared resource, like a printer, CPU task scheduling, etc.
- It is used in the asynchronous transfer of data e.g. pipes, file IO, and sockets.
-  Queues are used for job scheduling in the operating system.
- In social media to upload multiple photos or videos queue is used.
- **To send an e-mail queue data structure is used.**
- To handle website traffic at a time queues are used.
- In Windows operating system, to switch multiple applications.
