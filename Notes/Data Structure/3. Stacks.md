Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is [LIFO(Last in first out)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lifo-last-in-first-out-approach-in-programming/). Entering and retrieving data is possible from only one end. The entering and retrieving of data is also called push and pop operation in a stack. There are different operations possible in a stack like reversing a stack using recursion, Sorting, Deleting the middle element of a stack, etc.

## Characteristics of a Stack:

Stack has various different characteristics which are as follows:

- Stack is used in many different algorithms like Tower of Hanoi, tree traversal, recursion, etc.
- Stack is implemented through an array or linked list.
- It follows the Last In First Out operation i.e., an element that is inserted first will pop in last and vice versa.
- The insertion and deletion are performed at one end i.e. from the top of the stack.
- In stack, if the allocated space for the stack is full, and still anyone attempts to add more elements, it will lead to stack overflow.

## Operation performed on stack:

A stack is a linear data structure that implements the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Here are some common operations performed on stacks:

- **Push**: Elements can be pushed onto the top of the stack, adding a new element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: The top element can be removed from the stack by performing a pop operation, effectively removing the last element that was pushed onto the stack.
- **Peek:** The top element can be inspected without removing it from the stack using a peek operation.
- **IsEmpty**: A check can be made to determine if the stack is empty.
- **Size**: The number of elements in the stack can be determined using a size operation.

## Applications of Stack:

Different applications of Stack are as follows:

- The stack data structure is used in the evaluation and conversion of arithmetic expressions.
- Stack is used in Recursion.
- It is used for parenthesis checking.
- While reversing a string, the stack is used as well.
- Stack is used in memory management.
- It is also used for processing function calls. 
- The stack is used to convert expressions from infix to postfix. 
- The stack is used to perform undo as well as redo operations in word processors. 
- The stack is used in virtual machines like **JVM**. 
- The stack is used in the media players. Useful to play the next and previous song. 
- The stack is used in recursion operations.
