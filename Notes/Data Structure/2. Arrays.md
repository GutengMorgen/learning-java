## **Characteristics of an Array:** 

An array has various characteristics which are as follows:

- Arrays use an index-based data structure which helps to identify each of the elements in an array easily using the index.
- If a user wants to store multiple values of the same data type, then the array can be utilized efficiently.
- An array can also handle complex data structures by storing data in a two-dimensional array.
- An array is also used to implement other data structures like Stacks, Queues, Heaps, Hash tables, etc.
- The search process in an array can be done very easily.

## Operations performed on array:

- **Initialization**: An array can be initialized with values at the time of declaration or later using an assignment statement.
- Accessing elements: Elements in an array can be accessed by their index, which starts from 0 and goes up to the size of the array minus one.
- **Searching for elements**: Arrays can be searched for a specific element using linear search or binary search algorithms.
- **Sorting elements**: Elements in an array can be sorted in ascending or descending order using algorithms like bubble sort, insertion sort, or quick sort.
- **Inserting elements:** Elements can be inserted into an array at a specific location, but this operation can be time-consuming because it requires shifting existing elements in the array.
- **Deleting elements:** Elements can be deleted from an array by shifting the elements that come after it to fill the gap.
- **Updating elements:** Elements in an array can be updated or modified by assigning a new value to a specific index.
- **Traversing elements:** The elements in an array can be traversed in order, visiting each element once.

## **Applications of Array:** 

Different applications of an array are as follows:

- An array is used in solving matrix problems.
- Database records are also implemented by an array.
- It helps in implementing a sorting algorithm.
- It is also used to implement other data structures like Stacks, Queues, Heaps, Hash tables, etc.
- An array can be used for CPU scheduling.
- Can be applied as a lookup table in computers.
- Arrays can be used in speech processing where every speech signal is an array.
- The screen of the computer is also displayed by an array. Here we use a multidimensional array. 
- The array is used in many management systems like a library, students, parliament, etc. 
- The array is used in the online ticket booking system. Contacts on a cell phone are displayed by this array. 
- In games like online chess, where the player can store his past moves as well as current moves. It indicates a hint of position. 
- To save images in a specific dimension in the android Like 360*1200
