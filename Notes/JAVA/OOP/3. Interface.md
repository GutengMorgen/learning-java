## Simple definition/main idea
An interface in Java is a collection of abstract methods (methods without a body) that defines a contract for classes to implement. It provides a way to achieve abstraction and define a common behavior that can be shared by multiple classes. Interfaces define what a class should do (the methods it should implement) without specifying how it should be done.

Interfaces just specify the method declaration (implicitly `public` and `abstract`) and can only contain fields (implicitly `public`, `static` and `final`). Interface definition begins with a keyword **interface**. An interface like that of an abstract class cannot be instantiated. It is basically used to achieve abstraction.

## Syntax/Implementation
In Java, an interface is declared using the `interface` keyword followed by the interface name. It consists of method declarations, constants, and default methods. Classes implement an interface using the `implements` keyword in their declaration.
```java
public interface MyInterface {
    void method1(); // Abstract method declaration

    int CONSTANT = 10; // Constant declaration

    default void method2() {
        // Default method implementation
    }
}
```

```java
public class MyClass implements MyInterface {
    @Override
    public void method1() {
        // Method implementation
    }
}
```

## Technical Details
The interface in Java is _a_ mechanism to achieve [[11. Abstraction|abstraction]]. There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not the method body. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java. In other words, you can say that interfaces can have abstract methods and variables. It cannot have a method body. Java Interface also **represents the IS-A relationship**.

- An interface can contain method declarations (without method bodies), constant declarations (final variables), and default methods (methods with default implementations).
- Interfaces are used to achieve multiple inheritance of type, as a class can implement multiple interfaces.
- A class that implements an interface must provide an implementation for all the interface's methods.
- Interfaces can extend other interfaces using the `extends` keyword.
- Interface methods are by default public and abstract. They can be implicitly declared as `public abstract`.

## Key Concepts/Components
- Abstract methods: Method declarations without an implementation.
- Constants: Final variables declared within an interface.
- Default methods: Methods with default implementations that can be overridden in implementing classes.
- Multiple inheritance: The ability to implement multiple interfaces in a class.
- Interface inheritance: Interfaces can extend other interfaces to inherit their methods and constants.

## Best Practices
- Use interfaces to define behavior and contracts for classes to implement.
- Favor composition over inheritance when designing interfaces to achieve flexibility and loose coupling.
- Name interfaces based on the behavior they define (e.g., `Serializable`, `Comparable`).
- Keep interfaces focused and cohesive, defining only related methods.

## Limitations/Considerations
- Interfaces cannot be instantiated directly, but references of interface type can be used to refer to objects of implementing classes.
- Interfaces cannot have instance variables, but they can have constant variables.
- Changes made to an interface can potentially break the implementation of implementing classes.
