## Simple definition/main idea
In Java, a parameterized type refers to a class or interface that takes other types as parameters. **It allows you to create classes or interfaces that can work with different types without knowing the specific type in advance.** Parameterized types are commonly used with generics in Java to provide type safety and flexibility.

A parameterized type is defined by specifying one or more type parameters within angle brackets (`<>`) after the class or interface name. These type parameters act as placeholders for actual types that will be provided when creating an instance of the parameterized type.

## Syntax/Implementation
In Java, parameterized types are declared using angle brackets (`<>`) after the class or interface name. The parameter inside the angle brackets represents the type parameter.

```java
public class MyClass<T> {
    // Class body
}

public interface MyInterface<E> {
    // Interface body
}

public <T> void myMethod(T parameter) {
    // Method body
}
```

## Technical Details
- Parameterized types provide a way to create classes, interfaces, and methods that can operate on different data types without sacrificing type safety.
- The type parameter acts as a placeholder for a specific type that is provided at the time of instantiation or invocation.
- Parameterized types can be used with classes, interfaces, and methods.
- Type parameters are conventionally represented using uppercase letters (e.g., `T`, `E`, `K`, `V`).
- Type parameters can be bounded to a specific type or a set of types using the `extends` keyword.

## Key Concepts/Components
- Type parameter: Represents a placeholder for a specific type that is provided at the time of instantiation or invocation.
- Type argument: The actual type that is substituted for the type parameter when using a parameterized type.
- Type inference: The ability of the compiler to automatically determine the type argument based on the context.

## Best Practices
- Use parameterized types to create reusable and type-safe classes, interfaces, and methods.
- Choose meaningful and descriptive names for type parameters to enhance code readability.
- Utilize bounded type parameters to restrict the allowed types for a parameterized type.
- Take advantage of type inference to reduce the verbosity of code when using parameterized types.

## Limitations/Considerations
- **Parameterized types are only available at compile-time** and are erased at runtime due to type erasure. This means that type information is not available at runtime.
- Arrays of parameterized types cannot be created due to type erasure. Instead, you can use collections or other data structures from the Java Collections Framework.
- It is not possible to instantiate a parameterized type with a primitive type as the type argument. Instead, use the corresponding wrapper class (e.g., `Integer` instead of `int`).

## Example of impementation
```java
public class Box<T> {
    private T content;

    public Box(T content) {
        this.content = content;
    }

    public T getContent() {
        return content;
    }

    public void setContent(T content) {
        this.content = content;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Box<Integer> intBox = new Box<>(10);
        Box<String> stringBox = new Box<>("Hello");

        int intValue = intBox.getContent(); // Unboxing
        String stringValue = stringBox.getContent();

        System.out.println(intValue); // Output: 10
        System.out.println(stringValue); // Output: "Hello"
    }
}
```
In the above example, the `Box` class is a parameterized type that can hold any type of object. The type parameter `T` represents the type of the content stored in the box. In the `main` method, instances of `Box` are created with specific type arguments (`Integer` and `String`). The `getContent` method retrieves the content from the box, and the appropriate type casting (unboxing) is performed.
