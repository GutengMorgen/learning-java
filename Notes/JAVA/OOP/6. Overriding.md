## Simple definition/main idea
To override a method, you simply create a new definition for the method in the derived class. You’re saying, “I’m using the same interface method here, but I want it to do something different for my new type.”

If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as **method overriding in Java**.

## Syntax/Implementation


## Technical Details
- The method must have the same name as in the parent class
- The method must have the same parameter as in the parent class.
- There must be an IS-A relationship (inheritance).
- Both the superclass and the subclass must have the same method name and the same parameter list. The return type of overriding method is same or sub-type (covariant return type) of the return type of overridden method.
- We cannot override the method declared as `private`, `final` and `static`.
- We should always override abstract methods of the superclass.
- The access specifier for an overriding method can allow more, but not less, access than the overridden method (discussed later).
