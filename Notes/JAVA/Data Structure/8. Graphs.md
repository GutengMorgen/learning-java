A graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of vertices (or nodes) and edges. It consists of a finite set of vertices and set of edges that connect a pair of nodes. **The graph is used to solve the most challenging and complex programming problems.** It has different terminologies which are *Path, Degree, Adjacent vertices, Connected components, etc.*

## Characteristics of Graph:

The graph has various different characteristics which are as follows:

- The maximum distance from a vertex to all the other vertices is considered the Eccentricity of that vertex.
- The vertex having minimum Eccentricity is considered the central point of the graph.
- The minimum value of Eccentricity from all vertices is considered the radius of a connected graph.

## Operation performed on Graph:

A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. Here are some common operations performed on graphs:

- **Add Vertex:** New vertices can be added to the graph to represent a new node.
- **Add Edge:** Edges can be added between vertices to represent a relationship between nodes.
- **Remove Vertex**: Vertices can be removed from the graph by updating the references of adjacent vertices to remove the reference to the current vertex.
- **Remove Edge**: Edges can be removed by updating the references of the adjacent vertices to remove the reference to the current edge.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: A graph can be traversed using a depth-first search by visiting the vertices in a depth-first manner.
- B**readth-First Search (BFS):** A graph can be traversed using a breadth-first search by visiting the vertices in a breadth-first manner.
- **Shortest Path:** The shortest path between two vertices can be determined using algorithms such as Dijkstra’s algorithm or A* algorithm.
- **Connected Components**: The connected components of a graph can be determined by finding sets of vertices that are connected to each other but not to any other vertices in the graph.
- **Cycle Detection**: Cycles in a graph can be detected by checking for back edges during a depth-first search.

## Applications of Graph:

Different applications of Graphs are as follows:

- **The graph is used to represent the flow of computation.**
- It is used in modeling graphs.
- The operating system uses Resource Allocation Graph.
- **Also used in the World Wide Web where the web pages represent the nodes.**

## Advantages of data structure:

1. Improved data organization and storage efficiency.
2. **Faster data retrieval and manipulation.**
3. **Facilitates the design of algorithms for solving complex problems.**
4. Eases the task of updating and maintaining the data.
5. **Provides a better understanding of the relationships between data elements.**

## Disadvantage of Data Structure:

1. **Increased computational and memory overhead.**
2. Difficulty in designing and implementing complex data structures.
3. **Limited scalability and flexibility.**
4. Complexity in debugging and testing.
5. **Difficulty in modifying existing data structures.**
