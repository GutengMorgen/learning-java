A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers as shown in the below image: 

Types of linked lists:

- Singly-linked list
- Doubly linked list
- Circular linked list
- Doubly circular linked list

## Characteristics of a Linked list:

A linked list has various characteristics which are as follows:

- A linked list uses extra memory to store links.
- During the initialization of the linked list, there is no need to know the size of the elements.
- Linked lists are used to implement stacks, queues, graphs, etc.
- The first node of the linked list is called the Head.
- The next pointer of the last node always points to NULL.
- In a linked list, insertion and deletion are possible easily.
- Each node of the linked list consists of a pointer/link which is the address of the next node.
- Linked lists can shrink or grow at any point in time easily.

## Operations performed on Linked list:

A linked list is a linear data structure where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node. Here are some common operations performed on linked lists:

- **Initialization:** A linked list can be initialized by creating a head node with a reference to the first node. Each subsequent node contains a value and a reference to the next node.
- **Inserting elements:** Elements can be inserted at the head, tail, or at a specific position in the linked list.
- **Deleting elements**: Elements can be deleted from the linked list by updating the reference of the previous node to point to the next node, effectively removing the current node from the list.
- **Searching for elements**: Linked lists can be searched for a specific element by starting from the head node and following the references to the next nodes until the desired element is found.
- **Updating elements**: Elements in a linked list can be updated by modifying the value of a specific node.
- **Traversing elements:** The elements in a linked list can be traversed by starting from the head node and following the references to the next nodes until the end of the list is reached.
- **Reversing a linked list**: The linked list can be reversed by updating the references of each node so that they point to the previous node instead of the next node.

## Applications of the Linked list:

Different applications of linked lists are as follows:

- Linked lists are used to implement stacks, queues, graphs, etc.
- Linked lists are used to perform arithmetic operations on long integers.
- It is used for the representation of sparse matrices.
- It is used in the linked allocation of files.
- It helps in memory management.
- It is used in the representation of Polynomial Manipulation where each polynomial term represents a node in the linked list.
- Linked lists are used to display image containers. Users can visit past, current, and next images.
- They are used to store the history of the visited page.
- They are used to perform undo operations.
- Linked are used in software development where they indicate the correct syntax of a tag.
- Linked lists are used to display social media feeds.
